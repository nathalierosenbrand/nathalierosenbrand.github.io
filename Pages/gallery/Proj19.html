			<tr><td><p>This was a team project from the fourth quartile of my first year in CMGT. The team existed of six members: One engineer, two designers and three artists. The goal of the project was to make a chain-reaction combined with a puzzle game for the visitors of the local Makers festival. The goal of this festival was to educate children (age 5-12) and their parents about the importance of technology and creativity for the future.<br><br>
			With that purpose in mind we came up with a concept. We wanted to send a message with our project besides making it a fun experience. Thatâ€™s how we came up with WaterHeroes, a concept to teach children about clean water. <br><br>
