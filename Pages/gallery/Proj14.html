			<tr><td><p class="LongTXT">I used to have an Excel file that I used for every team-project and occasionally for my own planning. My team-mates always told me that they were very happy with how I lead the project as a scrum-master so, I assumed that my file was good.<br><br>
			But I showed it to a teacher who is very experienced with scrum and he told me that I actually donâ€™t keep track of user stories properly, because I keep track of the amount of hours worked and measure that against the amount of hours that everyone should be working (like 7 hours) based on that I make my burndown charts. What I should be doing is dividing the tasks at the start of the sprint and estimating how much time the sprint is going to cost and compare that to the time it actually costed to finish the user stories (and make a burndown chart of that).  <br><br>
			To fix this I created a new document with three different kind of tabs; In one I keep track of the user stories, the hours they took and who did them it also has the burndown-chart. Each member has their own tab where they keep track of their own user stories and the and one in which I make daily blogposts. <br><br>
