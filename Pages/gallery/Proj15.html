			<tr><td><p>During my minor I had to set my own goals and plan the whole process<br><br>
			I used the form provided by the minor to set my global goals. Then I cut those goals into user stories and those were my tasks that I used for my day-to-day planning in Trello and my excel file. <br><br>
			So, I made a week planning in the excel template and then I logged the daily results into Trello together with a short story about the day. I also used Excel to make burn-down-charts to keep track of my progress. <br><br>
			The minor helped me to better estimate time that I need for a task. <br><br>
