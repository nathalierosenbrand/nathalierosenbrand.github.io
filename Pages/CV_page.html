			<h2>Intro.</h2> 
			<p>So, you’re making games all day? That's what people assume when I tell them what I study. 
			But Creative Media and Game Technologies is much more than that, 
			it gives me the opportunity to connect my two favorite things; creativity and technology. 
			With my specialization as designer I learn a broad set of skills which range from 3D design till HTML/CSS.
			I enjoy working in a structured manner and I’m familiar with scrum to keep track of progress. 
			I’m curious and I love to learn new skills every day. I want to inspire other people to keep growing, 
			by using my designer skills to enhance the way people learn. 
			That’s why I look forward to work on serious games or E-learning materials in the future.</p>
