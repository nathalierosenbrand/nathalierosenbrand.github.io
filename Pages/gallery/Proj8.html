			<tr><td><p>During my minor I was allowed to do a project about whatever I wanted. I chose to do it about design thinking and gamification. So I went through (most of) the design thinking process and I researched the topic.<br><br>
			During my research I spent several weeks recalling and reorganizing all the information that I already learned during the CMGT course. After that I asked the lecture teachers of the modules for additional information and I also read papers on the topic online.<br><br>
			By doing this I learned a lot about e-learning, gamification and motivation theories.<br>
				
			After my desk-research I continued with field-research to discover the view of the users on the topic.<br>
