			<tr><td><p>This was a team project from the fourth quartile of my first year in CMGT. The team existed of six members: One engineer, two designers and three artists. The goal of the project was to make a chain-reaction combined with a puzzle game for the visitors of the local Makers festival. The goal of this festival was to educate children (age 5-12) and their parents about the importance of technology and creativity for the future.<br><br>
			At first we wanted to implement fluid-simulation, but sadly enough our engineer wasnâ€™t able to implement it in the game-engine we had to work with. We chose to use a ball to represent the water. The goal of the game was to guide the ball through a track using objects like an inclination to help it forward.<br><br>
