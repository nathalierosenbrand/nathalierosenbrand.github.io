			<tr><td><p>Phrase is a website that helps companies to translate their website or service. I learned to use Phrase so I could improve the Dutch translation of Seppo. <br><br>
			I first went through all of Seppo (so I pressed all the buttons and options that I could) and wrote the bad translations in an excel document. Then I went through it all with my internship coach to come up with improved translations. It is really cool to see that the current Dutch version of Seppo uses my translations.<br><br>
