			<tr><td><p>Seppo offers teachers the possibility to gamify their educational content. They can add exercises to a map (image or real-life map) and create stories with images videoâ€™s and other options. I worked as an intern in the first half of 2021. <br><br>
			To fill the library and to inspire teachers I created multiple demo games. These Sepp games have all the question types in it and are not too long, so new users can quickly play them to get an impression of what Seppo is and does.<br><br>
			I created the cybersecurity demo game for an event for ict in education. The game is about cybersecurity around the house an teaches users simple tricks to be save online. The game was such a success that it also has a (shorter, translated) version that will be used in the Trial project.<br><br>
			You can play the game at <a href="https://play.seppo.io/login_new?confirm_delete=true" >play.seppo.io</a> with the pin: 9GBCE2<br><br>
