			<tr><td><p>Seppo offers teachers the possibility to gamify their educational content. They can add exercises to a map (image or real-life map) and create stories with images videoâ€™s and other options. I worked as an intern in the first half of 2021.<br><br>
			The main focus of this project was to encourage users to use Seppo during their trial period (hence the name).<br><br>
			The first step that we took in project Trial was researching the audience. I did this by showing Seppo to people who had never interacted with it and observing their actions. Based on this experiment I made a user journey in which I mapped the critical points where users wanted to quit or got stuck. Based on this my colleague and I decided on the topics that we wanted to teach the users during their first interaction with Seppo.<br><br>
