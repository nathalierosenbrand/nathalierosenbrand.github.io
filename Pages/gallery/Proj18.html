			<tr><td><h1>Designing and printing own designs</h1></td></tr> 
			<tr><td><p>After I printed a few designs that I downloaded from the internet, 3D printing started to become a bit like printing normal documents (but then noisier and more tedious). To give myself some challenge I decided to make my own models to print. Although I have some experience with Maya (a program to make 3D models) I decided to search for better alternatives since I always have a hard time to find the exact measurements of models in Maya. When I found Fusion 360 I thought that it would be easy for me to use, since its owned by the same company as Maya (Autodesk). Sadly enough thatâ€™s not true, but I was able to make and print some basic shapes. I hope that I will be able to make and print more complex designs as I continue to practice with Fusion 360.
