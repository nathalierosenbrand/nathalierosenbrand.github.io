			<tr><td><p>At the start we planned to use real water for the chain-reaction, but as soon we realized that it was a bit dangerous to have water around electronics we decided that a glass marble could represent water as well. The machine starts by dropping a brown glass marble on a button concealed by a wooden structure. For the visitor it seems like the ball disappears into the machine and appears on the screen. After the game is finished a servomotor opens a lever at the other end of the machine and makes another transparent glass marble roll down the chain reaction.
