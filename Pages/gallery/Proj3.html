			After the <a href="Proj2.html">user journey</a> I went on to create a prototype so we could test if our ideas would help the user to understand Seppo better when they interact with it for the first time. <br><br>
			For this prototype I would use Figma for the first time. But I first created a simple storyboard on paper of all the screens that I thought I needed to double check with my colleague to see if we were on the same page. After that I simply digitalized the storyboard with photoshop and put the elements into Figma. <br><br>
			I tested the prototype with multiple people (inside and outside Seppo) and improved the prototype a where needed. <br><br>
			Looking back on my first experience with Figma I wish that I would have experimented with the program a bit more before I started with the actual prototype. Figma offers many ways to create buttons and other elements. Because I used photoshop images in Figma it was hard to swap things out or adjust them. <br><br>
