			<tr><td><p>Our project came together nicely, and it was well received by our teachers and the representatives of the festival. After the grading we were invited to present our installation at the makers festival together with the other winning teams! It didnâ€™t stop there, since our appearance at the makers festival we were invited to show our project at another festival for children and at the open days of our study.
