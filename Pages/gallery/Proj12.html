			<tr><td><p>After I brainstormed and found a solution during ideate it was time to make a simple prototype to test if the idea was the right solution for the audience. <br><br>
			The prototype was well received and after some adjustments I created a storyboard with all the screens and elements that would be necessary to build the project for real. I showed this to one of my UI/UX design teachers and he gave me some advice to fix alignment and create a more balanced user interface in general. .<br><br>
			Then I created a more polished version in Adobe XD as final result of my minor.<br><br>
