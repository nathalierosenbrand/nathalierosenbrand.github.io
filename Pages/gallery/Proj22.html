			<tr><td><p>During this project I was the team member responsible for planning and organization. We used scrum to plan weekly sprints which were divided in smaller parts by user stories.<br> Trello was the center of or plan infrastructure because that was the place all the user stories, requirements and progress came together. We labeled tasks per role and per member and moved them around between the backlog, work in progress, testing or finished.<br><br> We divided the tasks between the roles and in general:<br> The engineer built all the functionalities of the game in the GXP engine and connected it to the Arduino-output,<br> the designers were responsible for planning, presentations, website, promotional materials, stylesheet, Arduino hardware and UX/UI and <br>the artists made the mood boards, 2D-art, animations and the physical chain reaction.
