			<tr><td><p>Although my first print was perfect it didn’t stay that way, of course. When I printed more models I quickly discovered that the filament could get stuck, the z-axis could be wrongly calibrated, or the print temperature could be a bit off. In short 3D printing and solution-oriented thinking are connected to eachother. I’m glad that there is a lot of information about 3D printing and its problems online so that I can find aid with issues that I experience while printing. I also started to write down my own experiences and solutions so that I can use information if I come across a similar problem again.
