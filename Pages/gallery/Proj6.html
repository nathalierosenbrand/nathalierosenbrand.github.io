			<tr><td><p>Seppo offers teachers the possibility to gamify their educational content. They can add exercises to a map (image or real-life map) and create stories with images videoâ€™s and other options. I worked as an intern in the first half of 2021. 
			Seppo also has a blog section on there website. Here they ask employees and other experts to share their ideas and knowledge on Seppo or relevant topics (such as education and technology).<br><br>
			My colleague also asked me to write a blog for the website. After some brainstorming, I decided to write about how I use design thinking principles to create Seppo games. Because I made a workflow for building demo games during my internship. <br><br>
			The blogpost was very well received by my colleagues and they posted it to all the social media channels of Seppo. <br><br> 
			You can read the post <a href="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fseppoio%2Fposts%2F4083733508329484">here</a>
