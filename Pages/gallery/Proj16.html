			<tr><td><p>I’ve always had an interest for 3d printing, the limitless options to create fascinates me the same way as I’m drawn to designing (games and interactive applications), an 3D printer is also a great tool for prototyping. When I saw a nice offer during the quarantine I decided to give it a try and to buy my own 3D printer. The model that I decided to buy after extensive online research was the Ecubmaker ToyDiy 4-in-1 next to 3D printing it also offers CNC engraving and laser burning as functionalities which enables me limitless possibilities to create and design. <br><br>
			When I received the printer, I was glad that it was already montaged and calibrated when so I could use it right away. I started with printing a small box that removes dust and irregularities from the filament before it goes into the machine to avoid blockages while printing.<br><br>
