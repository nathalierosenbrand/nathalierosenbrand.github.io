			<h2> 11-10-2019 open day! </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/waterHeroesBlog.jpg" alt="">
		
			<p>Tonight I helped at the open day of my university. I was actually invited there by one of the teachers to showcase the Waterheroes project from the first year. I really liked it to welcome potential students and meet students from other years.</p>
			
			
			<h2> 29-10-2019 propaedeutic </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/prop.jpg" alt="">
		
			<p>Tonight was amazing. I received my (second) propaedeutic! It was in the evening and I was allowed to bring 3 people with me so I asked my parents and sister to come. Upon arrival we were welcomed with coffee and cake and after that we were called to the front of the room individually, to sign our papers and to give a short speech. Last year was amazing and I hope to contine with this great study!  </p>
            
			<h2> 5-12-2019 Project time! </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/TeamCRG.jpeg" alt="">
		
			<p>I´m currently working at a team project. We´re making a game that explains the different CMGT roles to the visitors of the open day. The team is amazing and I´m hoping for a good grade!  </p>
			
			<h2> 7-1-2020 Prototyping </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/OSCII.png" alt="">
		
			<p>During the course prototyping I learnt about how to use simple technology to test complex systems. After some testing around with the open sound protocol (OSC) I was able to add it to a unity project. If the user smiles it is detected via the AzureFaceAPI and that sends and analyzes the data via Wekinator (a machine learning program). Wekinator also uses OSC to send the data to Unity where the character will jump based on whether the user is smiling or not.

			<h2> 6-3-2020 Go Kibi! </h2>
			
			<video controls loop src="../Images/TeamKI.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
		
			<p>For project start-up we had 3 weeks to build a succesful concept to win the attention of a dragons' den filled with succesfull profesionals from the workfield and guess what? We won!! Kibi is an app that scans your receipts and stores them safely for you. It is also able to separate your purchases into categories and group them so you can keep track of your spending behavior, next to that it has the option for customized categories. We also made a desktop version for more complicated bookkeeping tasks.

			<h2> 1-5-2020 3D printer </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/FirstPRIMG.jpg" alt="">
		
			<p>Today my first 3D printer arrived and of course I needed to try it out! I'm glad that the printer came in one piece and that it was calibrated when I got it so I can use it right away. I’ve printed <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:190118" target="_blank" id="LExcel">a small box</a> that removes dust and irregularities from the filament before it goes into the machine to avoid blockages while printing.  
			</p>
            
			<h2> 5-6-2020 Printing my own design </h2>
			
			<video controls muted loop src="../Images/VID_3DBlog_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
		
			<p>I succeeded in printing my first (self-made) 3D design. It is only a simple shopping cart coin, but I hope that I will be able to make and print more complex designs as I continue to practice with Fusion 360.

			<h2> 22-10-2020 Persona minor skilled </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/Persona2.0 .png" alt="">
		
			<p>For my minor I want to design an app to make studying words/concepts easier and if possible more fun. To discover what my audience (between the 15 and 18 yers) prefers I did a survey and multiple interviews and bundled the results in an empathy map, persona and a user journey map.  
			</p>
            
			<h2> 4-2-2021 Results Skilled</h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/Astronaut.png" alt="">
		
			<p>After 5 months of work I finally finished my minor Skilled! During my minor I tried to gain a better understanding of the design thinking process and to learn more about how to apply gamification and motivation theories. My end result is a prototype in AdobeXD that conveys the main idea of my design. View the prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2e9d218f-5e91-420e-805f-ccebb6aa7b07-7bce/?fullscreen&hints=off" target="_blank">here</a>

			<h2> 8-2-2021 Internship at Seppo </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/Thumbnails/SeppoL.png" alt="">
		
			<p>Yay! Today I started with my internship at Seppo. I will work here from February till July.
			Seppo offers teachers the possibility to gamify their educational content. They can add exercises to a map (image or real-life map) and create stories with images video’s and other options. I look forward to helping both the Dutch and Finnish team with various projects.
			</p>
			
			<h2> 8-2-2021 Seppo demogame </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/EnglishAnn.png" alt="">
		
			<p>As an introduction to Seppo I created a demo game to discover how Seppo works and what possibilities it offers. The main goal of the game is to introduce potential users (language teachers) to Seppo and its possibilities. The game has 2 levels and shows all the question types (multi choice, creative etc.). This game allowed me to experiment with Seppo. 
			Currently this game is available in the Dutch library for potential clients to try. The game pin is: DB8825

			<h2> 18-4-2020 Multi modal interaction </h2>
			
			<video controls muted loop src="../Images/MMIvid.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
		
			<p>The goal of this subject is to teach us about different ways to interact with technology. So one of the grading criterea is that the project has different in- and outputs.<br>
			I wanted to experiment with my Kinect 360 sensor and I was able to create an environment where if you give audio input, the ducks come toward you and if you run or move your legs(in real-life) you can gather all the ducks in the scene.<br>
			I am very proud and happy with the result. Maybe it is not the most innovative, complicated project but, it showed me that I don’t always have to overdo it. On the other hand it still required a lot of patience and determination to finish it while working from home and doing the project next to my full-time internship.

			<h2> 10-6-2021 Seppo Dutch education event </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/Boat.jpg" alt="">
		
			<p>Seppo invited me to stand at their stand on the Dutch IT for education event. Because of Covid-19 it is not allowed for large groups to gather. As a solution the organisation of the OnderwijsMetICT-event (an IT event for education) decided to use a program, GoMeet to organize the event online. <br>
			I created a demo game about cybersecurity for this event (see demo games). The game fit the audience really well and also my biology demo was popular. <br>
			The online environment also had a (hidden) feature where you can steer a boat around the island. In the picture Jelle and I are cruising around.<br>
			Overall, I think that being on an event like this is a sign of trust from Seppo but, also an opportunity for me to become more accustomed with interacting with (potential) clients.
			</p>
			
			<h2> 10-6-2021 Seppo blogpost </h2>
			
			<img src="../Images/Blog.PNG" alt="">
		
			<p>This is not the only place where I keep a blog. In May my colleague asked me to write a blogpost for the Seppo website. 
			After some brainstorming, I decided to make a post about the best way to make a Seppo game. I choose the topic because it incorporated design thinking and the workflow that I use to make Seppo games. Since I am very familiar with these topics it easier to write something about it. <br>
			The blogpost turned out to be a success and it was posted to the official Seppo Facebook and LinkedIn. This was a great relief for me since I was a bit nervous about writing a blogpost at the start. I also translated the article to Dutch and it is translated to Finnish as well. You can find it <a href=" https://seppo.io/blog/how-to-make-an-amazing-seppo-game/" target="_blank">here</a><br>
